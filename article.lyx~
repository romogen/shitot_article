Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From elementary and high schools until college, students all over the world
 are mainly evaluated by exam grades.
 Thus, for them, studying well before exams is definitely a key to success.
 Our research focuses on the question whether, and more important - when
 and how, to study alone or as part of study group.
 Previous research has mainly focused on objective grades-driven estimations.
 Thus, not addressing the full, complex picture - excluding subjective aspects
 such as personal satisfaction and social ones as well.
 Today, as the expectation for personal customization is taken for granted,
 those kinds of research appears to be very limited in their ability to
 reach significant, practical outcomes and recommendations for students.
 In our study, we tried to overcome just that, examining students' grades
 as well as parameters like self-improvement, study time and satisfaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We spread a questionnaire between university students gathering information
 on study ways (alone vs groups), group sizes, exam types, group dynamics
 and knowledge gaps; and their effect on study effectiveness and exam results.
 It has been concluded that large groups and close relationships produced
 better effectiveness but worse results, as smaller knowledge gaps and theoretic
al exams had a positive influence on both aspects.

\begin_layout Subsection
Base Assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, as we assumed, there was no significant correlation found
 between exams results (Definition 1) and studying effectiveness (Definition
 2).
 Thus, our model's base assumption seems to be correct, and in order to
 examine the topic of study groups and address its complexity correctly
 and effectively - there is a need to examine those two parameters separately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking closely at the questionnaire results we can note several interesting
 points: 1.
 No groups recorded with more than 5 members.
 2.
 No groups recorded with indication of very large initial knowledge gaps
 between its members.
 3.
 No groups recorded with no relationships between group members.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those may indicate that even with no guidance, professional knowledge or
 some research outcomes usage; students tend to avoid studying in groups
 with such characteristics.
 It might sometimes be a result of previous experience with such groups
 that ended up with negative results or even a result of an intuition, as
 they 'feel' or believe it is not effective.
 Either way, it strengthens our model's hypotheses as to the preference
 to avoid attending such groups looking for better grades, satisfaction
 and study effectiveness.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Regrets and Social Effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to the percentage of students taking the questionnaire regretting the
 way they have chosen to study, no significant difference was found between
 students who studying by themselves and students who took part in a study
 group.
 A pretty low percentage was indicated for both in that aspect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examining social effects among students who have attended a study group,
 it was found that almost half of them indicated a positive effect on the
 relationships between group members as a result of studying together.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, they were also some students (almost 6%) stating the opposite,
 concluding that the study period ended up with a negative social effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Studying Alone vs In Group
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we'll address the question whether to study alone or as
 part of a group.
 In the next section, we'll address the different characteristics of study
 groups.
 In this study, we found a significant connection between students' exam
 performance and satisfaction, and study groups usage.
 Rybczynski et al.
 (2010) hasn't got to similar results in a study of undergraduate biology
 students at Miami University, where no differences found between exam scores
 of those who used study groups and those who did not.
 However, others (Sokolove and Marbach-Ad, 1999; Burrowes, 2003; Maloof
 and White, 2005; Tessier, 2007) has indeed indicated such difference.
 But, in all of the above studies, the subjective factor of students' satisfacti
on level hasn't been taken into account.
 In our investigation, participation in study groups have helped to achieve
 better exam results.
 In exams categorized as theoretical, this connection was even more significant
 (comparing to practical exams).
 It strengthens our model, which stated a hypothetical positive connection
 between exams considered theoretical and exam results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to the study effectiveness, a significant interaction was found between
 the exam type (theoretical or practical) and study groups usage.
 For theoretical exams, attending a study group has resulted in higher effective
ness.
 However, for more practical ones, higher effectiveness was reached studying
 alone.
 Such interaction is illustrated in Figure 1.
 It also connects to Rybczynski et al.
 that suggested that the benefits of study groups may extend beyond content
 gains as measured by test scores.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Study Groups Characteristics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we examined the exam type as well as the following study
 groups' characteristics: 1.
 Group size.
 2.
 Relationships between group members.
 3.
 Knowledge gaps.
 4.
 Initial relative knowledge level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reflect the data from this part of the study, two models were created.
 Those models reflect the linear regression equations produced for both
 exam results and study effectiveness.
 The first (Figure 2), represents the positive and negative factors for
 producing better exam results.
 The second (Figure 3), stands for producing better effectiveness.
 As to the exam results, a significant linear regression equation was found,
 showing that theoretical exams, smaller group sizes (2-3 members), higher
 level of initial relative knowledge and smaller knowledge gaps all result
 in better exam results, as our initial model states.
 However, too close relationships between group members might result in
 worse exam results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theoretical exams, initial relative knowledge of a higher level and smaller
 knowledge gaps appears to positively affect the study effectiveness also.
 But in contrast to exam results, better effectiveness is shown for groups
 with more members and also with closer relationships among them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That expresses a part of the difference between effectiveness and exam results,
 as students might feel that their studying group was very effective but
 end up not satisfied with their grade.
 Studying with more friends might make the process more fun and feel better,
 but lower the results from the same reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Implications for Practice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of our goals in this study is to be able to give some useful guidelines
 for students or even for students to be.
 By evaluating both the results and the study effectiveness separately,
 we aimed at addressing the study groups issue, its advantages and disadvantages
 in a more precise way.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Significantly better exam results and study effectiveness were found for
 groups with no more than 3 members, with small knowledge gaps among them.
 Being able to attend such a group, when your initial knowledge level comparing
 to the other group members is pretty high, is very advisable according
 to our results.
 Looking at the numbers, such combination appears to increase the general
 exam results average (which is a number between 0 and 50) by 12 points,
 and the general effectiveness average rate (which is between 0 and 5 points)
 by 0.7 points.
 By concluding both the grade and the satisfaction level from it as the
 exam results, we believe that our results can be stronger and better adjusted
 to students, and thus more practical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rybczynski et al.
 concluded that instructors giving some guidance to students can be very
 helpful working as a group.
 A possibility of combining that kind of guidance with our findings and
 implications may be even better in leading students to both arrange and
 study in groups more effectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Threats to Validity and Limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The limitations and threats to our results validity, which can be both internal
 and external, include: 1.
 Limited sample size, of 129 participants.
 2.
 The questionnaire was spread to university students only.
 3.
 Inaccurate questionnaire answers (both intentionally and unintentionally).
 4.
 Parameters such as study environment and more aspects of group dynamics
 were not taken into account.
