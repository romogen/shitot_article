Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From elementary and high schools until college, students all over the world
 are mainly evaluated by exam grades.
 Thus, for them, studying well before exams is definitely a key to success.
 Our research focuses on the question whether, and more important - when
 and how, to study alone or as part of study group.
 Previous research has mainly focused on objective grades-driven estimations.
 Thus, not addressing the full, complex picture - excluding subjective aspects
 such as personal satisfaction and social ones as well.
 Today, as the expectation for personal customization is taken for granted,
 those kinds of research appears to be very limited in their ability to
 reach significant, practical outcomes and recommendations for students.
 In our study, we tried to overcome just that, examining students' grades
 as well as parameters like self-improvement, study time and satisfaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We spread a questionnaire among university students gathering information
 on study ways (alone vs groups), group sizes, exam types, group dynamics
 and knowledge gaps; and their effect on study effectiveness and exam results.
 It has been concluded that large groups and close relationships produced
 better effectiveness but worse results, as smaller knowledge gaps and theoretic
al exams had a positive influence on both aspects.

We found out hat most of the papers observe the success only by the raw
 grade and thos who do take into assumption the experince and satisfication

 Our research is facing this problem and we try to weigh the satisfication
 from the grade with the raw grade score.

\begin_layout Section
Research Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Systematic literature review was selected as the research methodology for
 this study.
 The systematic literature review method is a well-defined approach to identify,
 evaluate and interpret relevant studies regarding a particular research
 question, topic area or phenomenon of interest.
 This method was chosen because we wanted to get a fair, credible and unbiased
 evaluation of ideas to when and how we’d prefer studying in groups over
 studying alone before tests.
 The systematic review was performed as shown in Figure 1 and the main steps
 of our research method are presented in Figure 2.
 At first, we searched articles and related works (Section 3) manually on
 the web, mainly in Scholars.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.1 Data Collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data collection was done in a staged process: first, each journal and
 conference venue was manually reviewed by reading its title and keywords.
 Then, we searched studies identified in related reviews and followed up
 on references in studies found at the first stage.
 Finally, a more profound examination was done, and we merged and summarized
 the results.
 Along the process, we’ve focused on articles related to our model’s parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.2 Definitions After collecting the data and analyzing the related works,
 we defined main terms relevant to our research in order to create a common
 language.
 The first definition is “Study Effectiveness”.
 Study Effectiveness is a weighting of 3 parameters – study time, improvement
 and knowledge level after studying (and before actually taking the exam).
 These 3 parameters were measured in a scale of 1 to 5.
 Study time was measured as 5 minus the actual value, since low value of
 time represents high record.
 The study effectiveness was calculated as average of these 3 parameters.
 The second definition is “Exam Results”, which is a conclusion of both
 grade and satisfaction level.
 Grade is a value in scale of 0 to 100, and satisfaction level of 1 to 3.
 In order to combine these parameters, we multiplied them and divided by
 6, which led to a final value between 0 and 50.
 The weighting was done by the multiplication operation, while the division
 did not modify the statistical analysis nor the results, but only reduced
 the range.
 By combining these 2 parameters we relate also to the expected score of
 the student and get a more accurate measure to the success of an individual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.3 Research Model and Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following step was constructing an initial research model, followed
 by defining hypotheses.
 Our initial Research Model consisted of 6 variables.
 Studying effectiveness and test results (discussed in section 4.2) are both
 dependent variables, and the rest are independent.
 The first independent variable is relationships between the group members.
 We assumed that close relationships is key to a qualitative learning.
 Additionally, it may improve group chemistry and studying experience.
 The next variable is the knowledge gaps among group members.
 In case the gaps are too large we may impair the quality of studying and
 the ability of each individual to make a significant profit.
 At the same time, we assumed small knowledge gaps improve the quality of
 the collective learning, help narrowing the gaps and sustain improved understan
ding through explanations: Those who struggle can narrow their minor gaps,
 while those who explain sharpen their understanding.
 The following variable is the nature of the exam – realistic or theoretical.
 We would like to examine whether there is a way to classify the various
 subjects according to this criterion.
 In practical subjects the main study strategy is practicing.
 On the one hand, if another group member solves the exercise we miss out
 on the study process.
 On the other hand, practicing in groups allows us to compare answers among
 group members.
 In theoretical subjects, group studying allows discussion and sharing ideas
 which contributes to each individual in the group.
 Finally, the last variable is the group size.
 Limited group size may contribute to effective studying and to the ability
 of each individual to express freely.
 Too large groups may cause distraction and detract from the studying quality
 of the material.
 The model is represented in Figure 3.
 Along the research we added a confounder to our model, and then redefined
 the hypotheses.
 The cofounding variable is personal level of knowledge relative to the
 group.
 This variable is related to the knowledge gaps, and grant subjective aspect,
 relative to rest of the group members.
 Now, our hypothesis - small knowledge gaps among group members improve
 understanding through explanations, relating specifically to each individual's
 knowledge level (relative to the other group members).
 In addition, we decided to change the relation between relationships among
 the group members and study effectiveness from ‘+’ to ‘?’ since we identified
 other aspects: close relationships may be an obstacle and a distraction
 to the group members, for it is more likely to transfer the conversation
 topic from the learnt subject to unrelated (probably personal) issues.
 Also, sometimes tension develops among the members of the group.
 The refactored model is represented in Figure 4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.4 Research Tools Afterwards, we assembled a questionnaire – our research
 tool.
 The questionnaire was based on possible ideas and conclusions from the
 related works.
 After receiving a first review on the questionnaire, we fixed it accordingly
 and finally distributed it.
 The changes included clarifying the term “Study effectiveness”, adding
 the option to mention the exact score of the exam, and dividing the questionnai
re into two separate sections to get a more readable questionnaire.
 The questionnaire suits the research model, takes into account each of
 our variables and is available at https://goo.gl/forms/qExJ7c4H8ll6WOC82.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final step was analyzing the results in order to answer our research
 questions and draw some conclusions based on them.

Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Base Assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, as we assumed, there was no significant correlation found
 between exams results (Definition 1) and studying effectiveness (Definition
 2).
 Thus, our model's base assumption seems to be correct, and in order to
 examine the topic of study groups and address its complexity correctly
 and effectively - there is a need to examine those two parameters separately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking closely at the questionnaire results we can note several interesting
 points: 1.
 No groups recorded with more than 5 members.
 2.
 No groups recorded with indication of very large initial knowledge gaps
 between its members.
 3.
 No groups recorded with no relationships between group members.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those may indicate that even with no guidance, professional knowledge or
 some research outcomes usage; students tend to avoid studying in groups
 with such characteristics.
 It might sometimes be a result of previous experience with such groups
 that ended up with negative results or even a result of an intuition, as
 they 'feel' or believe it is not effective.
 Either way, it strengthens our model's hypotheses as to the preference
 to avoid attending such groups looking for better grades, satisfaction
 and study effectiveness.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Regrets and Social Effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to the percentage of students taking the questionnaire regretting the
 way they have chosen to study, no significant difference was found between
 students who studying by themselves and students who took part in a study
 group.
 A pretty low percentage was indicated for both in that aspect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examining social effects among students who have attended a study group,
 it was found that almost half of them indicated a positive effect on the
 relationships between group members as a result of studying together.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, they were also some students (almost 6%) stating the opposite,
 concluding that the study period ended up with a negative social effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Studying Alone vs In Group
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we'll address the question whether to study alone or as
 part of a group.
 In the next section, we'll address the different characteristics of study
 groups.
 In this study, we found a significant connection between students' exam
 performance and satisfaction, and study groups usage.
 Rybczynski et al.
 (2010) hasn't got to similar results in a study of undergraduate biology
 students at Miami University, where no differences found between exam scores
 of those who used study groups and those who did not.
 However, others (Sokolove and Marbach-Ad, 1999; Burrowes, 2003; Maloof
 and White, 2005; Tessier, 2007) has indeed indicated such difference.
 But, in all of the above studies, the subjective factor of students' satisfacti
on level hasn't been taken into account.
 In our investigation, participation in study groups have helped to achieve
 better exam results.
 In exams categorized as theoretical, this connection was even more significant
 (comparing to practical exams).
 It strengthens our model, which stated a hypothetical positive connection
 between exams considered theoretical and exam results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to the study effectiveness, a significant interaction was found between
 the exam type (theoretical or practical) and study groups usage.
 For theoretical exams, attending a study group has resulted in higher effective
ness.
 However, for more practical ones, higher effectiveness was reached studying
 alone.
 Such interaction is illustrated in Figure 1.
 It also connects to Rybczynski et al.
 that suggested that the benefits of study groups may extend beyond content
 gains as measured by test scores.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Study Groups Characteristics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we examined the exam type as well as the following study
 groups' characteristics: 1.
 Group size.
 2.
 Relationships between group members.
 3.
 Knowledge gaps.
 4.
 Initial relative knowledge level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reflect the data from this part of the study, two models were created.
 Those models reflect the linear regression equations produced for both
 exam results and study effectiveness.
 The first (Figure 2), represents the positive and negative factors for
 producing better exam results.
 The second (Figure 3), stands for producing better effectiveness.
 As to the exam results, a significant linear regression equation was found,
 showing that theoretical exams, smaller group sizes (2-3 members), higher
 level of initial relative knowledge and smaller knowledge gaps all result
 in better exam results, as our initial model states.
 However, too close relationships between group members might result in
 worse exam results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theoretical exams, initial relative knowledge of a higher level and smaller
 knowledge gaps appears to positively affect the study effectiveness also.
 But in contrast to exam results, better effectiveness is shown for groups
 with more members and also with closer relationships among them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That expresses a part of the difference between effectiveness and exam results,
 as students might feel that their studying group was very effective but
 end up not satisfied with their grade.
 Studying with more friends might make the process more fun and feel better,
 but lower the results from the same reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Implications for Practice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of our goals in this study is to be able to give some useful guidelines
 for students or even for students to be.
 By evaluating both the results and the study effectiveness separately,
 we aimed at addressing the study groups issue, its advantages and disadvantages
 in a more precise way.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Significantly better exam results and study effectiveness were found for
 groups with no more than 3 members, with small knowledge gaps among them.
 Being able to attend such a group, when your initial knowledge level comparing
 to the other group members is pretty high, is very advisable according
 to our results.
 Looking at the numbers, such combination appears to increase the general
 exam results average (which is a number between 0 and 50) by 12 points,
 and the general effectiveness average rate (which is between 0 and 5 points)
 by 0.7 points.
 By concluding both the grade and the satisfaction level from it as the
 exam results, we believe that our results can be stronger and better adjusted
 to students, and thus more practical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rybczynski et al.
 concluded that instructors giving some guidance to students can be very
 helpful working as a group.
 A possibility of combining that kind of guidance with our findings and
 implications may be even better in leading students to both arrange and
 study in groups more effectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Threats to Validity and Limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The limitations and threats to our results validity, which can be both internal
 and external, include: 1.
 Limited sample size, of 129 participants.
 2.
 The questionnaire was spread to university students only.
 3.
 Inaccurate questionnaire answers (both intentionally and unintentionally).
 4.
 Parameters such as study environment and more aspects of group dynamics
 were not taken into account.

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our research we wanted to understand whether, and more important - when
 and how, to study alone or as part of study group.
 We spread a questionnaire among university students gathering information
 on study ways (alone vs groups), group sizes, exam types, group dynamics
 and knowledge gaps; and their effect on study effectiveness and exam results.
 It has been concluded that large groups and close relationships produced
 better effectiveness but worse results, as smaller knowledge gaps and theoretic
al exams had a positive influence on both aspects.
 Our model parameters were considered significant by more than 55% of participan
ts.
 The most significant one indicated was the Group Size, supported by more
 than 75% of questionnaire respondents.
 For future work, we’d like to also examine the effects of Studying Environment
 and Group Dynamics, as suggested by some of the respondents.
 We’d also like to spread the questionnaire to a larger number of respondents
 in order to get better feedback and more reliable results.
